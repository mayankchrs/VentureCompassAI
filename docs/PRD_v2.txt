## 4) Advanced LangGraph Coordination Patterns

### Multi-Phase Execution Flow
```
Phase 1: Discovery
├── Discovery Agent (Map company digital presence)
└── Generates: Company aliases, key URLs, digital footprint

Phase 2: Parallel Research (Fan-out)
├── NewsRetriever (Enhanced with Discovery context)
├── PatentHunter (Uses verified company names)
└── DeepDive Agent (Crawls discovered pages)

Phase 3: Verification & Synthesis (Fan-in)
├── Verification Agent (Cross-validates all findings)
└── InsightSynthesizer (Creates final report)
```

  name, domain, aliases[], digital_footprint,
  discovery_metadata, confidence_scores
}

sources: {
  run_id, agent_id, source_type, url, 
  confidence_score, verification_status
}

agent_runs: {
  run_id, agent_name, start_time, end_time,
  api_calls_made, tokens_used, success_rate
}

reports: {
  run_id, executive_summary, risk_assessment,
  confidence_overall, export_formats[]
}
```
